This is my FPGA project to render a digital clock on a VGA display. The code is written in verilog for the clock counters and the display driver module. 

The board I used is a Basys 3 and documentation of the board can be found here: [reference manual](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual?srsltid=AfmBOor96-ybgW8E7NDMI9Ye_8qXkQf3WOY56LjjYa2G6hOn34lWD2vV)
